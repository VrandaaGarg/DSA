<h1>What is a Leader?</h1>
<p>An element is considered a <strong>leader</strong> if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In an ascending sorted array, the only leader is the last element.</li>
  <li>In a descending sorted array, all elements are leaders.</li>
  <li>If there is an element on the right side that is equal, then even the current element is <strong>not</strong> a leader.</li>
</ul>
