# N-th Fibonacci Number Using Matrix Exponentiation

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `N`. Your task is to find and return the N-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The Fibonacci number is calculated using the following formula:
\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \]
where:

- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- \( F(2) = 1 \)

### Example

For `N = 5`, the output will be `5`.

## Explanation

The Fibonacci sequence starts as:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

For `N = 5`, the 5th Fibonacci number is `5`.
