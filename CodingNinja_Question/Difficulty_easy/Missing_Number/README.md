# Missing Number Finder

## Problem Statement

Given an array `a` of size `n-1` with elements ranging from `1` to `n`, where each element is unique and no duplicates are present, the task is to find the missing number in the range `[1, n]`.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `n`, representing the size of the range of numbers.
- The second line contains `n-1` space-separated integers representing the elements in the array `a`.

## Output Format

- Print a single integer representing the missing number in the range `[1, n]`.

## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^6 \)
- \( 1 \leq a[i] \leq n \)
- Time Limit: 1 second

## Expected Time Complexity

- The expected time complexity is \( O(n) \).
