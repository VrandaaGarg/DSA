# Make Binary String Beautiful

Ninja has been given a binary string `STR` containing only `'0'` or `'1'` characters. A binary string is considered **beautiful** if it contains alternating `0`s and `1`s.

### Examples of Beautiful Strings

- `"0101"`
- `"1010"`
- `"101"`
- `"010"`

### Problem

Ninja can make `STR` beautiful by performing operations to convert `'0'` into `'1'` or vice versa. In one operation, he can change a single character in `STR`.

Your task is to determine the **minimum number of operations** Ninja should perform to make `STR` a beautiful string.

### Example

Given the binary string `STR = "0010"`, the minimum number of operations to make it beautiful is `1`.
