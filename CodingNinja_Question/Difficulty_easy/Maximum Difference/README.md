## Problem Statement

You are given an array `ARR` of `N` elements. Your task is to find the maximum difference between any two elements from `ARR`.

If the maximum difference is even, print **"EVEN"** (without quotes). If the maximum difference is odd, print **"ODD"** (without quotes).

### Example:

Given `ARR = [1, 10, 5, 2, 8, 1]`, the answer is **"ODD"**.  
Here the maximum difference is between 10 and 1:  
`10 - 1 = 9`.
