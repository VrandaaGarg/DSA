# Rotate 1D Array to the Left

## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` with `n` elements, the task is to rotate the array to the left by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

### Examples

- For `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
  - If `k = 1`, the rotated array is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.
  - If `k = 2`, the rotated array is `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.
  - If `k = 3`, the rotated array is `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.
