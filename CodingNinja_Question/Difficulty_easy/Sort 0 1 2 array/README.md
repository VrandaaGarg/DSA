# Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array/list (ARR) of size 'N'. The array only contains the integers 0, 1, and 2. Your task is to sort this array/list in such a way that all 0s come first, followed by all 1s, and then all 2s.

### Requirements

- The sorting should be done in a single scan, meaning you should iterate over the array/list just once. In other words, each element in the array/list should be visited only one time.

## Input

- An integer array/list `ARR` of size `N`, where `N` is the number of elements in the array. The elements of the array are restricted to the values 0, 1, and 2.

## Output

- The sorted array/list in the order of 0s, followed by 1s, and then 2s.
