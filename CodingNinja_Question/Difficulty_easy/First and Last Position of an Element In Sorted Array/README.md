# Problem: First and Last Occurrence of an Element in a Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

You are given a sorted array (or list) `arr` consisting of `n` elements. You are also given an integer `k`. Your task is to find the first and last occurrence of `k` in `arr`.

### Notes:

1. If `k` is not present in the array, then both the first and the last occurrence should be `-1`.
2. `arr` may contain duplicate elements.

### Example

**Input:**

- `arr` = [0, 1, 1, 5]
- `k` = 1

**Output:**

- `1 2`

**Explanation:**  
If `arr` = [0, 1, 1, 5] and `k` = 1, then the first and last occurrence of `1` are at indices `1` and `2`, respectively.
