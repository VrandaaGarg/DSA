// Circular doubly linked list:
// Every node has two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node.
// In CDL, previous of the head node points to the tail node and next of the tail node points to the head node.

// Empty CDL:
//  head = NULL

// CDL with one node:
//  head -> 1 -> head
// head->next=head;
// head->prev=head;
